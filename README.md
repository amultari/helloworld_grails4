# helloworld_grails4

This is a sample project made in Grails 4 managing just one domain class, Authors (named Autore in the project). It exposes a web GUI and also a rest API listening on localhost:8080/gestioneautore/api/autore.

## Getting Started

After cloning:

```
cd helloworld_grails4
grails run-app
```

### Prerequisites

You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed, but it is not necessary to install Groovy because it's bundled with the Grails distribution.

To install Grails, visit http://grails.org/Download and download the version you would like to use. Set a `GRAILS_HOME` environment variable to point to the root of the extracted download and add `GRAILS_HOME/bin` to your executable `PATH`. Then in a shell, type the following in order to check installation:	

```
grails -version
```
