Grails
===

[Grails](https://grails.org/) is a framework used to build web applications with the [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org/) programming language. The core framework is very extensible and there are numerous [plugins](https://plugins.grails.org/) available that provide easy integration of add-on features.

Grails is sponsored by [Object Computing Inc.](https://www.ociweb.com) in St. Louis Missouri.  Please contact <info@ociweb.com> for support inquiries.

Getting Started
---

You need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed, but it is not necessary to install Groovy because it's bundled with the Grails distribution.

To install Grails, visit http://grails.org/Download and download the version you would like to use. Set a `GRAILS_HOME` environment variable to point to the root of the extracted download and add `GRAILS_HOME/bin` to your executable `PATH`. Then in a shell, type the following:

	grails create-app sampleapp
	cd sampleapp
	grails run-app

To build Grails, clone this GitHub repository and execute the install Gradle target:

    git clone https://github.com/grails/grails-core.git
    cd grails-core
    ./gradlew install

If you encounter out of memory errors when trying to run the install target, try adjusting Gradle build settings. For example:

    export GRADLE_OPTS="-Xmx2G -Xms2G -XX:NewSize=512m -XX:MaxNewSize=512m -XX:MaxPermSize=1G"
